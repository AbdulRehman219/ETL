🚀 Bank Market Capitalization Data Pipeline — End-to-End ETL Flow

Today, I built a complete ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads global bank market-cap data using Python.

🔹 Extract: Scraped archived Wikipedia data using requests & BeautifulSoup
🔹 Transform: Joined exchange-rate data, cleaned the dataset, and converted market caps across currencies using pandas
🔹 Load: Exported the final processed dataset into a clean CSV ready for analysis

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
✔ Data Engineering
✔ Web Scraping
✔ ETL Pipelines
✔ Python Automation
✔ Working with Real-world Financial Data

Always learning, always building. 💡
